# Contributing to App Food UI

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to App Food UI.
These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment,
and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Commits

We're using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), so use following prefixes for your commits:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **chore**: A change that is related to dependencies, imports, format changes - not worth any other prefix
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

## Proposing a Change

If you intend to add a feature, or make any non-trivial changes
to the implementation, we recommend filing an issue.
This lets us reach an agreement on your proposal before you put significant
effort into it.

If you’re only fixing a bug, it’s fine to submit a pull request right away
but we still recommend to file an issue detailing what you’re fixing.
This is helpful in case we don’t accept that specific fix but want to keep
track of the issue.
